# Web-Scraper
Scrapes sites like amazon, new egg, best buy, target and walmart to find items the user searches for and parse the information using beatiful soup to displays the items picture and information like price, it then tracks the price and price history in a SQL database 
# Still a work in progress, I eventually want to fully implement the data base and show the user a graph displaying the history of the price over time, either going up or down and whether or not they should buy if the price is at an all time high
